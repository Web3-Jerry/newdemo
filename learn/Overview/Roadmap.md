# Roadmap
The vision of Bitlayer will be realized through the rollout of a mainnet in multiple stages, with each phase designed to enhance the user experience and bolster security through cryptographic proof of Bitcoin consensus and onchain activity.

## First Stage: Bitlayer Mainnet-V1
In this initial phase, Bitlayer will support the cross-chain movement of BTC/BRC-20 assets between the Bitcoin mainnet and Bitlayer, and other mainstream assets, thereby enriching the overall value of the Bitlayer ecosystem.

During this stage, we will prioritize offering a 100% EVM-compatible development kit and ecosystem support, enabling developers to quickly build, test, and deploy applications on Bitlayer. Solidity applications can be seamlessly migrated, providing early users with the benefits of low gas fees and an extensible Bitcoin framework.

## Second Stage: Bitlayer Mainnet-V2

In this phase, we plan to introduce a Sequencer+DA model, which, based on the DLC|BitVM technical protocol, secures user asset deposits and withdrawals. Additionally, utilizing multisig oracles for challenges and DLC-Attestors controlled by multisig for asset escape will be implemented.

By leveraging the vast network and security of Bitcoin, Bitlayer will continuously lead with the highest security standards, offering users enhanced flexibility and an improved onchain experience through network upgrades.

## Third Stage: Bitlayer Mainnet V3
In this phase, our aim is to implement OP challenges based on BitVM, along with decentralized DLC-Attestors for asset escape.
Upon the completion of this third stage, Bitlayer’s final mainnet will be fully deployed, achieving the network's original goals—Bitcoin-equivalent security combined with Turing completeness. 

This version is set to elevate the security standards of Bitcoin Layer 2 to an unprecedented level.
