# Bridges

Bridges play a crucial role in connecting Bitlayer with other blockchain networks, enabling seamless interoperability and cross-chain asset transfers. Through bridges, Bitlayer users and developers can leverage the power of multiple blockchain ecosystems. Bitlayer is designed to support various bridge implementations to facilitate communication between different blockchains. This section provides an overview of the available bridges in the Bitlayer ecosystem.

## Bitlayer < - > Blockchains

When integrating Bitlayer with Bitcoin or Bitcoin-compatible chains, it is recommended to utilize bridge solutions such as UniSats or Xverse. These bridges enable the transfer of assets between Bitlayer's Layer 2 solution and the Bitcoin blockchain. By bridging the gap between Bitlayer and Bitcoin, users can enjoy the benefits of Bitlayer's EVM compatibility while leveraging the security and liquidity of the Bitcoin network.
 
## Bitlayer < - > CEXs (Centralized Exchanges)

Bitlayer also supports bridges that connect with centralized exchanges (CEXs). With these bridges, users can withdraw their assets from centralized exchanges directly to Bitlayer's ETH-compatible wallet address. This allows users to seamlessly transfer funds from centralized exchanges to Bitlayer and leverage the Layer 2 capabilities provided by Bitlayer.

By leveraging bridges, Bitlayer expands its reach and connectivity, enabling users to interact with a wide range of blockchain networks and centralized exchanges. Developers can explore and integrate these bridges into their applications, providing users with enhanced flexibility and access to various blockchain ecosystems.
